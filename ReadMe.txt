Problem Definition : With the rise of AI writing tools (e.g., ChatGPT),    plagiarism in school and college 
                     submissions has evolved. Standard tools like Turnitin fail to detect AI-generated original 
                     content. Thus develop a Conference Management ToolKit   for research paper 
                     conference 
# Task : CMT is like a digital detective + supportive teacher for research papers — ensuring originality, spotting AI overuse, and maintaining fairness in academic conferences.

# Challenge : 
--Flag AI-written or AI-influenced submissions.
--Detect plagiarism in multiple languages and paraphrased text.
--Identify if the writing style matches the claimed author.

# Features : 1. Author Stylometry Tracking 
--Builds a personal writing “fingerprint” for each author.
--Flags when a submission doesn’t match their usual style.
2. AI-Generated Content Detection
--Uses entropy & perplexity to catch text that feels “too AI-like.”
--Detects hidden AI-watermarks in generated writing.
3. Advanced Plagiarism Checker 
--Works across multiple languages.
--Catches rephrased, paraphrased, and translated content.
--Detects plagiarism from research papers, blogs, and online articles.
4. Reviewer Dashboard 
--Easy-to-read interface for conference organizers.
--Provides originality score, AI-likelihood score, and plagiarism report.
5. Explainable Reports 
--Instead of just “flagging,” the system explains why a section is suspicious.
--Helps authors improve and resubmit.
6. Multi-Language Support 
--Works for English + regional languages (important for global conferences).
7. Seamless Integration 
--Can be integrated into existing conference paper submission systems.
--API-based design for future scalability.
